Given a list of integers, how do you find all pairs of integers in the list that sum to a specific number?

There are a few ways you could find all pairs that sum to a specific number.

One way you could do it is subtract each integer from the specific number,
and check if the resulting number appears anywhere on the list.

Another way is to go down the line adding integer 1 to 2, 3, 4... until you reach the end.
Then, start at integer 2 and work your way up again.

To add efficiency, you could eliminate numbers in the list that couldn't possibly sum up to the specific number.
For example, if the number is positive, no two negative numbers could sum to it.
Conversely, two positives could not sum to a negative number. Or, in a list of all positive numbers, numbers
greater than the specific number could never sum up to that specific number in any combination.
